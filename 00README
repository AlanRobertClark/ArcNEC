# ***My*** version of NEC that is ***TOTALLY*** open source in every
# conventional sense of that word.

# we will start with a NEC output reader (Pascal days.....) using Octave
# only. Gather all output in a UserData structure of the Current Figure.
# Use ArcMakeMenu to get the GUI functional on the collected Data.

#apt install libatlas-base-dev

$cd necpp
$make -f Makefile.git
$./configure

$vi +413 src/matrix_algebra.cpp

#include <atlas/clapack.h>

make -j 4

produces src/nec2++ which can be copied to ~/bin, or sudo make install
which I did not want.

Unfortunately it needs -i hi.nec -o hi.out....
